#' Conclusion: There are a few things we can look at when doing the analysis for
#' the length of life. One of the first things I would think of is to compare the 
#' of presidents to the general population. Usually, presidents are men of considerable
#' social and economic power and with that we can assume that they have better access
#' to medicine and the most state of the art treatments. Unfortunately, this is compicated
#' a bit by the fact that we are looking at a data set across time to is difficult 
#' to compare the life expectancy at any given year to the average of the presidents.
#' With that being said, according to Harvard, the life expectancy in 1900, or roughly the halfway
#' mark of the age of the Republic, was 47. The president at that time was William McKinley,
#' President number 25. The average life expectancy of the Presidents is 72 while the 
#' average one today is 77. Based, is that it looks like Presidents on average do
#' live longer than the average person. My second question with from the data is 
#' how is the distribution of life length for presidents. Looking at the histogram,
#' it seems that there is a bell curve for the life length of presidents with more presidents
#' living less than the median. As the life expectancy continues to increase, I expect the
#' frequency to increase at points higher than the median and for the median to 
#' increase as well.
